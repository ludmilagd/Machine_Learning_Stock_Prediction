# Machine Learning for Stock Market Prediction

Analyzing Apple Stock Data to Predict Gain/Loss leveraging Machine Learning Models

Data Source: Yahoo Finance

Overview: 

Stock market prediction have been very popular for a long time. As the worlds changes constantly and every event have an impact in the global economy, the need of better ways to predict the future value of stocks is always present.

Machine Learning has proved to be a good predictor for stock prices. However, there are several models available and the present project intetent to compare 4 of these models to predict Apple Stock Prices. 

The Machine learning models were processed in jupiter notebook utilizing Python, Pnadas and Matplotlib to create trend charts. Results of the different models were saaved in Github to later be used by the application.
The app would get information directly from Yahoo finance website through a Python command. This porcess runs every time the application is open making sure that information is updated up to date.
Dash plotly was the tool selected to present the results of this analysis. Dash is a Javascript library that combines Flasks, HTML and charting capabilities to create interactive visualizations with amazing features. The Flask application connects a local host service to storage information retrieved from yahho finance and from a local/github drive to later be ploted and rended in an HTML format file.
The final application was launched to the internet in Heroku Plataform. Heroku is a cloud plataform that allows users to deploy and run applications in a cloud

The four models selected are: Moving Average, LSTM (Long Short Term Model), Decision Tree and Linear Regression. 
In this applciation, built in Dash JavaScript, will provide the user three different Machine Learning Models to predict Stock Market Value for Apple. 
It also present a chart to compare historical Stock price for companies in different Industry Sectors. 

Technologies:Herouku, Python, Matplotlib, Pandas & Dash Plotly 
Machine Learning Models: Moving Average, LSTM (Long Short Term Model), Decision Tree and Linear Regression.
